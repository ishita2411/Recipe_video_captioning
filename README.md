# VIDEO_CAPTIONING_PIPELINE
We attempt to tackle the challenging task of recipe
generation from videos using only pre-trained
models. We divided the process of recipe generation
into various modules which include event
generation, frame extraction, featurizing frames,
removing frame redundancy, frame enhancement,
frame captioning, and summarization using LLM.
We used various pre-trained models to perform
different tasks required to achieve desired results
at each stage of our recipe generation pipeline.
We used the temporal nature of videos, and the
power of image embeddings, and harnessed the
power of LLMs to extract meaningful content and
generate recipes in an efficient manner. We have
demonstrated the quality of the recipe generated
using various metrics which highlight the impact
of our work.
